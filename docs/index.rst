Welcome to active-mri-acquisition's documentation!
==================================================
``active-mri-acquisition`` is a package that facilitates the application of reinforcement learning
to the problem active MRI acquisition. In particular, ``active-mri-acquisition`` provides a gym-like
environment for simulating the execution of policies for k-space sampling, allowing users to
experiment with their own reconstruction models and RL algorithms, without worrying about
implementing the core k-space acquisition logic.
